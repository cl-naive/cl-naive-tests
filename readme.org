# cl-naive-tests

A test framework that is not explicitly based on any of the mainstream
popular testing frameworks for other languages. It has a very simple
api, so the learning curve should be considerably less than for most
other frameworks.

It is also designed to work well with gitlab CI out of the box and
still be simple!

To put its simplicity in perspective here is what you need to know at
different levels of expertise:

User:

You need to grok lisp conditionals like if, and, or etc.

From this package you will need to use the following functions
register-test, test, run and report.

Super User:

You will have to add statistics, format-results and write-results to
your arsenal as well.
